Write a logger
Assume you have a workspace with multiple applications
 (build by angular cli or nx)  and your goal is to implement a logger package
  that will serve them all to capture HTTP errors, requirements:
The logger data will include the message, stack trace, and timestamp.
The logger will write its errors to:
console.
localstorage
The logger will be used only in production.
Use the logger to log HTTP errors thrown in the application.
Use logger to log also exceptions thrown anywhere in the application.
Make the logger module configurable that will include:
Message format
Targets (console, localstorage etc.)
Etc.
Manage the logs in a queue and flush the queue to targets every 5sec
 (this should also be configurable, both the use of queue + flush timing) - The queue should be implemented using RxJs.
